The behaviour of Java's `ForkJoinPool` is not always what it seems when you use it in a web application hosted in link:https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] / link:https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty] and can lead to some surprising consequences.      

In this blog we explore some  'missing classpath resource' issues that can be caused by reliance on the `ForkJoinPool` Classloader in Web Applications. 
     
== The Mystery of the Missing Classpath Resources

Embedding resources in your classpath is a typical way to ensure that you can access important files in a platform-agnostic and to avoid the many idiosyncrasies specific to each operating system implementation. 

In addition, you may consider using Java's built-in `ForkJoinPool` and not spawn your own thread pool in order to avoid what has been described as the link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/33704032[tragedy of the commons]. 

This can lead to some unforseen consequences, however. Consider the following code example and output:

[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/")
public class ForkJoinPoolResourceServlet extends HttpServlet
{
  public static final String CLASSPATH_RESOURCE = "devworx-resource/document.txt";
  
  @Override
  protected void doGet(   HttpServletRequest req, 
              HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException
  {
    final PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter();
    writer.write("<html>");
    
    writer.write("<h2>(1) - " + CLASSPATH_RESOURCE + " is : " + 
           getContent( Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(CLASSPATH_RESOURCE)) +
           "</h2>");
    
    writer.write("<h2>(1) - ClassLoader: " + 
            Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() + // List my class loader
            "</h2>");
   
    ForkJoinTask<?> task = ForkJoinPool.commonPool().submit(() -> 
    {
      writer.write("<h2>(2) - " + CLASSPATH_RESOURCE + " is : " + 
              getContent( Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(CLASSPATH_RESOURCE)) +  
             "</h2>");
      
      writer.write("<h2>(2) - ClassLoader: " + 
            Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() + 
            "</h2>");
    });
    ...
    task.get();
    ..
    writer.write("</html>");
  }
  
  private String getContent(InputStream ins)
  {
    try
    {
      if(ins == null) return "NULL";
      else return IOUtils.toString(ins, "UTF-8");
    } 
    catch (IOException e)
    {
      throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected error ! - " + e, e);
    }
  }
}

First time you load this page, you get:

But then when you refresh - you get the following:

In this relatively simple example this is not an issue. However, as part of a much bigger application and workflow this can cause serious issues.  

== The Switching of Contexts

From the example above, it is clear that the `ContextClassLoader` changes over the course of the application's deployment. And certainly, looking at some of the link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html[Tomcat Resources] on class loading - it becomes clear why relying on a common pool (which may be loaded as part of the Bootstrap or System ClassLoaders) is best avoided.

This particular nuance proved to be quite a costly delay in the development of my project. Hence an important lesson from this experience:

TIP: Be in control of your own thread pools and classloader contexts. Be aware that behaviour in your test case runtime may be radically different from the behaviour in the runtime of a container.
